# TREXPEN_TREXPIC
Python code for embedding (un)directed (possibly weighted) networks into Euclidean or hyperbolic space of any number of dimensions with the dimension reduction techniques named TREXPEN (TRansformation of EXponential shortest Path lengths to EuclideaN measures) and TREXPIC (TRansformation of EXponential shortest Path lengths to hyperbolIC distances).
